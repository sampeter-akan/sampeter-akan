# 👋 Hi, I'm Samuel Peter

**Infrastructure Operations Specialist | Power Grid → Cloud DevOps | MSc DevOps & Cloud Computing**

With 19+ years in electric power system operations, I’ve transitioned from managing high-voltage transmission networks to architecting cloud-native infrastructure solutions. My journey bridges traditional grid reliability with modern DevOps practices—where uptime, automation, and innovation converge.

Currently pursuing an MSc in DevOps and Cloud Computing, I’m focused on building smart grid monitoring platforms using Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. My portfolio showcases how operational excellence meets technical innovation.
